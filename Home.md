# MIDAS 2019 Novel Coronavirus Repository
This repository serves as central platoform to share resources relevant for modeling of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. The repository was created by the [IDAS Coordination Center (MCC)](https://midasnetwork.us/mcc/), who will continue to maintain it in collaboration with the broader modeling community. Community members are encouraged to contribute resources to the repository and thus support the overall 2019-nCoV research effort. 

## [Data](https://github.com/midas-network/2019-ncov/wiki/Data)
All data sources relevant for 2019-nCoV modeling can be uploaded/found here, including case count data and line listings. Data are uploaded by the MCC and by community members. Data can be in many different formats and levels of curation. Sets of related data files are presented as "collections". For example, a collection can be a set of related outbreak situation updates from a country, a set of time-stamped backup files, or another set of related files. Each collection has its own metadata, data guide, and location dictionary that maps geographic locations listed in the collection to international standards.

## Parameter estimates
Once CSV file with estimates for epidemiological parameters relevant for nCoV modeling extracted from a variety of sources including preliminary model reports, pre-prints, and peer-reviewed publications. For each parameter, metadata are also extracted. Parameter estimates are extracted by a team of curators from the MIDAS Coordination Center and others, and reviewed by community members (list here) for accuracy. A subset of the CSV file is displayed in a readme file.

## [Algorithms & Visualizations](https://github.com/midas-network/2019-ncov/wiki/Algorithms-&-Visualizations)
Source code and/or links to algorithms for data-processing and modeling will be included in this section together with relevant metadata. Links and metadata for visualizations and dashboards related to 2019-nCoV are also listed. 

## [Documents](https://github.com/midas-network/2019-ncov/wiki/Documents)
All documents relevant to 2019-nCoV can be posted in this section. Documents are mostly organized by country or by topic. Pre-prints and peer-reviewd manuscripts are posted with links to external webpages while all other documents are stored in this repository and internal links to those documents are listed. Documents include:
* Reports, inlcuding outbreak situation reports/updates, modeling reports and other "grey literature"
* Pre-prints and peer-reviewed publications, organized by topic
* Guidelines by WHO, China, and US CDC related to 2019-nCoV
