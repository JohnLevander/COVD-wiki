# MIDAS 2019 Novel Coronavirus Repository
</br>
</br>
</br>
This repository serves as central platform to share resources relevant for modeling of the COVID-19 outbreak. The [MIDAS Coordination Center (MCC)](https://midasnetwork.us/mcc/) has created and will maintain it in collaboration with the broader modeling community. Community members are encouraged to contribute resources to the repository and thus support the overall COVID-19 research effort. See [Information for Contributors](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Information-for-Contributors) for guidance on how to contribute material. Contact questions@midasnetwork.us for any questions or ideas for improvements, or to send/request any material to be included. 

## MIDAS 2019 Novel Coronavirus Mailing List
The MIDAS Coordination Center maintains a dedicated mailing list for updates and news about COVID-19 modeling research. To join the mailing list, please email questions@midasnetwork.us. 

## [Data](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Data)
All data sources relevant for COVID-19 modeling can be uploaded/found here, including case count data and line listings. Data are uploaded by the MCC and by community members. Data can be in many different formats and levels of curation. Sets of related data files are presented as "collections". For example, a collection can be a set of related outbreak situation updates from a country, a set of time-stamped backup files, or another set of related files. Each collection has its own metadata, data guide, and location dictionary that maps geographic locations listed in the collection to international standards. See [Information for Contributors](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Information-for-Contributors) for the most recent metadata and data guide templates. 

## [Parameter estimates](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/tree/master/parameter_estimates/2019_novel_coronavirus)
Once CSV file with estimates for epidemiological parameters relevant for nCoV modeling. Estimates are extracted from a variety of sources including preliminary model reports, pre-prints, and peer-reviewed publications. For each parameter, metadata are also extracted. Parameter estimates are extracted by a team of curators from the MIDAS Coordination Center and community members. A subset of the CSV file is displayed in a readme file. New parameter estimates can be added by appending the CSV file (see [Information for Contributors](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Information-for-Contributors)).

## [Software Tools](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Software-Tools)
Software tools for data-processing, modeling, and visualizations will be included in this section together with relevant metadata. Once CSV catalog file includes all tools, each on a separate row, and all tools are listed [here](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Software-Tools). New tools can be added by appending the [CSV file](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/blob/master/software_tools/software_catalog.csv) or submitting an [issue](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/issues). 

## [Documents](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/wiki/Documents)
All documents relevant to COVID-19 are posted in this section. Documents are mostly organized by country or by topic. Pre-prints and peer-reviewd manuscripts are posted with links to external webpages only while all other documents are also stored in this repository as collections in the [documents folder](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/tree/master/Documents). Add new documents by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/issues) with the document information.

Documents include:
* Reports, inlcuding outbreak situation reports/updates, modeling reports and other "grey literature"
* Pre-prints and peer-reviewed publications, organized by topic
* Guidelines by WHO, China, and US CDC related to COVID-19
